Since my elementary years, internet and the web pages displayed have always been my friend and one of the things that I see the most in my daily life. However, while exposed to frameworks through internet, I was not interested at all and did not even try to see what is inside when I accidently clicked f12. Even when I got into ICS program and started learning about the coding and languages related, still HTML, CSS, and UI seemed far away from either my interest or relationship with my major.

When I have courses to start learning about and actually practiced making html with CSS, some basics were understandable but it became another new interesting experience in my life. Visually seeing my lines of codes creating frameworks of web pages was one of the excitement while learning about html with CSS. However, when I started learning and applying Semantic UI, it just blew my mind in both good and bad ways. Using actual words, which semantically make sense, was just sensational to me and it made my practices on frameworks on pages more enjoyable. It is obvious that as I dig more about Semantic UI, it will be getting complex but still is going to be powerful framework to use and I do not think I will be working with raw HTML with CCS unless I have to. With the semantic words provided in Semantic UI, I feel like I can even write a plan sheet and apply it exactly words by words to the frameworks and I believe that can be one benefit in terms of software engineering.

Semantic UI is the one and only UI frameworks that I have learned and knew about so far and I did find myself enjoying it, so I do not know about other frameworks and cannot compare Semantic UI with other UI frameworks but, learning new things can be exciting if I am, despite the challenges that might come, willing and ready to accept.

In conclusion, despite their potential complexity and the independency that HTML and CSS have, UI frameworks, Semantic UI in this case, perceived to me as an option but an essential option for creating web frames.
