Every time learning or knowing new things, my favorite list gets updated that the new things become my favorite on the list, and this new application architecture called Meteor appeared, and just reordered my favorite list. In the beginning, it just came to me as unknown, mysterious, meaningless chunk of rock called meteor from space where I do not know. Even though I was following the tutorial, I did not fully understand what I was doing. Moving back and forth from client, server, ui, and handling events, objects, helper, authentication, and so on, many parts were dealt through tutorial but still I felt like I was blinded. Also, even installing the meteor package threw errors and failed to install. So, I did not like it in the beginning, however everything was somehow magically working and starting to notice that after the pain of tutorial to create example mockups, I began to see how things work little by little.

After beginning to see how things work, the unknown, mysterious chunk of space rock called meteor all of a sudden changed into precious stone that worth possessing. Once finishing creating pages, through html, js, ui, style, from client and server, everything became easy to add, modify. Also, things that I have been learning, like JavaScript, HTML, and Semantic UI, helped to decrease the difficulties of Meteor. Additionally, running the meteor through terminal and seeing changes in runtime was the best part and easiness of implementing security was another part that I felt nice. Before using Meteor, a modern, internet-based, client-server application architecture, I have never used any of this kind and all the time I had to run manually or refresh to see the output, which can be irritating at certain point. Of course Meteor requires some installations and it has to be run in the projectâ€™s app directory, but once you run it, I do not need to care about it until I finish the work. So, personally I feel that this kind of small steps to run meteor are worth doing.

In conclusion, the modern, internet-based, client-server application architecture called Meteor, which came into my life as like mysterious tool that does things somehow magically, but when I began to understand little by little, it became one of my favorite tool to use. However, I have only tasted the small part of this application architecture and still many things are left to learn about but until that moment, or maybe not, meteor will be remained as one of my favorite among many tools.
