To be honest, when I first got accepted and started to major in Information and Computer Science, one of my motivations was to make games through learning and majoring in this area. The term 'software engineering' was very unfamiliar to me at that time and I did not know many things about software engineering and thought that software engineering was only for those who are majoring in engineering kind. Even when I am applying for courses, I was wondering why CS or ICS major student have to learn an area of engineering.

As the time went on and started to explore more about software engineering, the things I have been doing, like Java, C, or other programming languages or systems that I have been learned were the fruit of software engineering and engineerâ€™s efforts. Also, when I found out that software engineering can be applied to many areas, I felt like I was thrown into whole new world naked. However, after researching about the area of software engineering, what interests me was creating, or making software. It sounds like the most difficult thing but something new is what always making me exciting. Because when I learn and do programming or coding, even though I felt that still many skills and experiences lacking inside of me, I feel like what I am doing is reproducing what the pioneers had accomplished. However, learning how to do programming, understanding the concepts and ideas, experiencing through actual practicing are the keys to create something on my own.

So, for my future, first of all, I want to solidify my foundations, and wanting to develop more coding skills, understanding the concepts and ideas about software and programming, and hoping to get internship or real developing experiences before I graduate.
