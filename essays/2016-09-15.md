Configuration management, when I think about this word, all I remember is the word "config" on the games, internet, and files in computers. Since my first language was Korean, I did not know what the meaning was, but naturally it became the one I should not be touching unless I really need to touch it. So, to be honest, I knew almost nothing about configuration management until I was accepted into Information & Computer Science major.

While learning, the first version control system that I had engaged with was Makefile from C. Not only the ability that enables people to organize code for compiling but also the ability for controlling version and keeping up to date that C has was just amazing and comfortable. Despite the truth that there were no projects using Makefile for coding with other people, it was enough and clear for me to understand how important configuration management is and what will happen if there are no ways to configure files.

With many kinds of open source codes and function as social community for coders, GitHub also offers version control ability through Git, and I think Git and GitHub both equally contributed them to be popular and successful and the community hub for open source and coding. Since both served their purposes faithfully so that they became widely loved and visited website and system and I think it is a discourtesy to weight on one side for the other sideâ€™s popularity.
