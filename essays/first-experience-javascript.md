As a JavaScript beginner, the first impression about JavaScript that as soon as I began to solve practices was “how can you declare variable without data types, how can it be.” Java and little bit of C were the only programming language I have learned so far. I am not sure whether I have to say “untyped” or “dynamically typed,” or any other expressions, but that mattered big to me as beginner. After the experience, the rest seemed reasonable and even if there were differences, they were acceptable and okay. In terms of comparison with C, it was a whole new thing since I have to trace the pointer in C, but in the perspective of Java learner, JavaScript was quite enjoyable and the tutorial was not difficult to follow.

Then, is JavaScript a good software engineering language? Before setting my heart to major in Information and Computer Science, and learning any programming language, one of the debate that I often encountered from some sources or from people as beginner was whether Java is better or C language is better. Later when I learned that many parts of Java and JavaScript were based or derived from C language, my thought was, “what is the point of debating which one is better.” Everything has plans and purposes for their creation, so I believe that it is the matter of how I or you like it and where and what are you and I going to do with.

Departing from the story of perspectives, personally, I think the concept of athletic software engineering and the WOD (Workout of the Day) is needed, like exercises to lose weight or make body, but they are painful. Since it is only the beginning, I am not sure whether this will be the method that fit to my life but certain stress, in positive view, through the WOD will be helpful to forge my skill and my lifestyle too.
