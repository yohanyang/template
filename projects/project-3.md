This project is about exploring the history of World War II, especially focusing on South East Asia. Starting from the stories of prewar and cause, situations of each country, soldiers, civilians, and consequences, many stories were explained with maps, online history archives, databases, and readings. The articles were posted through Edublogs, a free educational blogs and websites powered by WordPress

It may seems off from the projects related to software or technologies, the reason why I chose this project is because it was the first online blog activity that I have ever done in my life. Even though I knew blogs and websites, but I did not have any experiences about them. However, through the this experience, not only gaining knowledges about the history of WWII in South East Asia, but also gaining experiences about maintaining, updating, writing essays, posts, and linking maps, archives, and many sources from the internet to the blog. This experience actually helped me later when I am using WordPress, PHP, and cPanel in ICS courses. So, this might consider as nothing, but it is something in my experience.
